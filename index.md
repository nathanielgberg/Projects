# Hey!
## I am a third year student at UCSD studying **Computer Engineering** with a minor in Finance. I am really interested in pursuing a career in product management.

A quote I live by:
>"Everything Happens for a Reason"

Some of my favorite code commands are:
```
cd
ls
git add
```
One of my favorite hobbies is I love to build robots. I have competed on Battlebots for two years now. Here is a link to my team [Riptide](https://battlebots.com/robot/riptide-2021/). Additionally here is the link to my [README file](Projects/README.md)

I also love to travel and have been to quite a few countries. Here are some of my favorites.
- France
* Italy (here are some cities I visited)
1. Rome
2. Venice
3. Naples
+ Israel

My current task list.
- [ ] reach a bodyweight of 165
- [ ] travel all 7 wonders of the world
- [ ] finish my education
